# PngMe (The Zig Version)

## Introduction
This is the implementation of [Pngme project](https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/introduction.html) in Zig. It can encode your secret message into a png file.
Obviously you can decode the message from the file (if you have the secret key) and remove the secret message from the file.

I don't wanna write the whole thing so here are some pictures. I think they are self explanatory.
